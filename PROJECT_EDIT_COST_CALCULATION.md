# Project Edit - Estimated Cost Calculation Feature

## Overview
The project edit page now displays real-time estimated cost calculations based on assigned team members' hours and salaries. Costs are calculated using the formula: `(estimate hours) * (salary / (22 * 8))` where 22 represents working days per month and 8 represents hours per day.

## Features

- **Per-User Basis**: Each assigned team member has their own cost calculation
- **Formula**: Hours Ã— (Annual Salary Ã· (22 working days Ã— 8 hours/day))
- **Display Location**: Appears below the estimated hours input field
- **Styling**: Green text with dollar sign icon for clear identification

### Total Project Cost

## Cost Calculation Formula
