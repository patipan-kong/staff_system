# LeavePolicy Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Created Components:**

### 1. **LeavePolicy** (`app/Policies/LeavePolicy.php`)
- **Authorization Methods**: Complete policy with all CRUD and approval permissions
- **Role-Based Access**: Differentiates between staff, managers, and admins
- **Status-Based Logic**: Only pending leaves can be modified by users
- **File Security**: Medical certificate download authorization

### 2. **Policy Registration** (`app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php`)
- Registered `Leave` model with `LeavePolicy`
- Auto-discovery enabled for authorization calls

### 3. **Enhanced LeaveController** (`app/Http/Controllers/LeaveController.php`)
- **Added Method**: `downloadMedicalCertificate()` with proper authorization
- **Existing Methods**: All methods already use `$this->authorize()` calls
- **File Security**: Secure download with proper filename and path validation

### 4. **New Route** (`routes/web.php`)
- **Medical Certificate Download**: `/leaves/{leave}/medical-certificate`
- **Protected Route**: Requires authentication and proper authorization

### 5. **Updated Views**

#### **Leave Show View** (`resources/views/leaves/show.blade.php`)
- **Authorization Directives**: Replaced manual checks with `@can` directives
- **Enhanced Medical Certificate**: Added download button with file info
- **Policy Integration**: Uses `@can('update', $leave)`, `@can('approve', $leave)`, etc.

#### **Leave Index View** (`resources/views/leaves/index.blade.php`)
- **Authorization Directives**: All action buttons now use `@can` directives
- **Clean UI**: Consistent button visibility based on permissions

## 🔐 **Authorization Rules:**

### **View Permissions:**
- ✅ **Own Leaves**: Users can view their own leave requests
- ✅ **All Leaves**: Managers/Admins can view any leave request

### **Modify Permissions:**
- ✅ **Pending Only**: Users can only edit/delete their own PENDING leaves
- ✅ **Admin Override**: Admins can modify any leave regardless of status

### **Approval Permissions:**
- ✅ **Manager/Admin Only**: Only managers and admins can approve/reject
- ✅ **No Self-Approval**: Users cannot approve their own leave requests

### **File Access:**
- ✅ **Secure Downloads**: Medical certificates require proper authorization
- ✅ **File Validation**: Checks file existence before serving
- ✅ **Proper Naming**: Downloads use secure, descriptive filenames

## 🎯 **Security Features:**

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for staff, managers, admins
2. **Ownership Validation**: Users can only modify their own data
3. **Status Protection**: Approved/rejected leaves cannot be modified by users
4. **Self-Approval Prevention**: Managers cannot approve their own requests
5. **File Security**: Medical certificates are served securely with authorization
6. **Clean URLs**: All routes require proper authorization

## 📋 **Policy Methods:**

| Method | Staff | Manager | Admin | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| `viewAny()` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All can access leaves index |
| `view()` | Own only | All | All | Can view specific leave |

## ✅ **Testing Status:**

- ✅ **Policy Registration**: Properly registered in AuthServiceProvider
- ✅ **Route Authorization**: All routes protected with middleware and policies
- ✅ **View Authorization**: All UI elements use proper `@can` directives
- ✅ **File Security**: Medical certificate downloads are secure
- ✅ **Controller Authorization**: All controller methods use `$this->authorize()`

The LeavePolicy is now **fully implemented** with comprehensive authorization covering all aspects of leave management! 🎉
